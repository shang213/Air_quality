# Air_quality
Within an Italian city, there was a dataset collection of hourly average air quality responses. The data was collected from a field within a populated area at road level over a one year time span, from the date March 2004 to February 2005. 

By using an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device, the data was separated into what different metal oxide chemical observations were found, CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). 

The dataset of 9358 recordings includes the date, time, and hourly averages of each chemical looked for in each individual data point collected.
